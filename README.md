# Image segmentation based on OpenCV, Adjusted to work with Debian (and probably other linux distros)

"It works for me now... I think" 

Follow the repo back in time to see where it was abandoned on OSX, the make file should work going forward on Debian. 


not sure if this is helpful futureself but:

uname -a: 
    Linux 4.9.0-6-amd64 #1 SMP Debian 4.9.82-1+deb9u3 (2018-03-02) x86_64 GNU/Linux

apt search libopencv-dev:
    libopencv-dev/stable,now 2.4.9.1+dfsg1-2 amd64 [installed]
